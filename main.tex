\chapter{Introduction}
\textit{
Since the development of electronic devices, people have utilised them extensively in the creation of art, especially music. From the theremin to synthesizers to trackers and modern day Digital Audio Workstations (hereafter referred to as DAWs), electronics have enabled people to compose music easier than ever before, and to achieve previously unachievable sounds.
}

This dissertation explores the full capability of modern computers to facilitate a particular style of artistic audio composition. It presents a novel piece of software (tuPAC) that aims to achieve this goal through a graphical user interface, which has been evaluated against an industry-standard audio composition tool (elaborate on results). The project focuses on catering to a style of musical composition focused on the usage of vocal sounds in unconventional ways, often using layering, repetition and nonsensical utterances to portray a feeling or artistic idea. The research and development was done with guidance from an artist who is interested in this style of composition.

\section{Motivation}
In Western classical music, a motet is a style of polyphonic vocal composition, generally without instrumental accompaniment. Polyphonic compositions consist of multiple voices with different melodies. Isorhythmic motets are particularly related to this project as they are characterised by the repetition and augmentation of sections of the composition. [citation needed] 

Many contemporary artists have experimented with vocal sounds for the creation of texture in music. Steve Reich is a prominent composer most well known for his work creating minimalist music. Much of his work uses voices not to communicate a message through the words, but in order to create a texture. One example is his composition Proverb \cite{ReichProverb}, which has 3 singers repeating parts of a text at different times, layered over each other.

\section{Background}
 Modern digital music production is primarily done with DAWs. Popular DAWs like Ableton, FL Studio and Logic Pro are used almost universally in the composition of modern music, and such are a go-to for artists looking to create music through digital means. 

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/ableton example.png}
    \caption{UI of Ableton Live}
    \label{fig:ableton}
\end{figure}

However, the design of these programs doesn't lend itself to all forms of composition equally, and whilst they work well in general, there certainly is different approaches to software design that would better cater to the needs, in terms of functionality and ease of use, of specific use cases.

Another approach to digital audio composition is live coding. This is a technique used to generate art in real time using software - specifically with programming languages. For music, a popular example is Sonic Pi.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/sonicpi.png}
    \caption{UI of Sonic Pi}
    \label{fig:sonic_pi}
\end{figure}

Live coding software allows users to generate audio through writing programs, with the defining feature being the ability to modify the code whilst the audio is running and seamlessly change the audio as it is played. This approach to making music is vastly different from industry-standard DAWs, and is often used for performance art.

Live coding platforms differ from DAWs in that there is generally less complex functionality, with more focus on simpler but easier manipulation, particularly the repetition and augmentation of sounds previously defined. This makes the process of live coding plausible in real time whilst still sounding good. This approach is much closer to the goal of this project, and so was a primary focus of research and preparation.

\section{Project Aims}
The artist involved with this project had previously endeavoured to digitally compose vocal music along the same lines of the previously mentioned compositions in a DAW, but had found the software overwhelming and difficult to work with. This project aimed to design a system specifically for this type of composition from scratch. To design a system which accurately represented the structure of this type of composition, and allow the composer to manipulate the system in an intuitive way, unrestricted by the design of the system.
